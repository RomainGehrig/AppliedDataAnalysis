# Twitter Vote

# Abstract
Voting participation is declining and is particularly low for young people, but people express their opinions more and more on social medias.
Does opinions expressed on Twitter reflect the opinion of all the population?

We want to understand how the opinion of the Swiss population evolve before and after a Federal votation using the tweets referring it.
Knowing the results, we can put in perspective the tweets and compare the opinion of people region by region.

# Research questions
  * Are the sentiments towards a votation different from the results?
  * Do they change after knowing the results?
  * Would it be possible to predict the results?
  * How the sentiment evolve through time? Is there turning points? And what caused them?

# Dataset
The Swiss tweets dataset will be our primary source, with it's sentiment score used to evaluate the feeling of Swiss people about a votation.
We will also use the votation results to draw a parallel with Twitter.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
We will explore the Swiss Twitter dataset to understand which votations have been discussed on the platform and select a set of them.
We can then select a votation and start extracting informations from the tweets.
We will produce a map of Switzerland where we can display the results of the votations and our analysis with different resolutions (by region, city, etc.)

# Questions for TAs
Not for now, but we won't hesitate to ask on Mattermost if needed!
